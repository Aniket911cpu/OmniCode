# OmniCode Programming Language

## Overview
OmniCode is a revolutionary programming language designed to be **the fastest, most efficient, and most versatile** language ever created. It seamlessly integrates the best features of existing languages while eliminating their weaknesses, making it ideal for **game development, web applications, AI, blockchain, IoT, high-performance computing, and scientific research**.

OmniCode is built using **C++ with LLVM integration**, supporting both **Just-In-Time (JIT) and Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation**, ensuring maximum performance. It also allows **direct hardware communication** through **inline assembly** and provides **a high-level, expressive syntax** for modern software development.

## Key Features
### **1. Universal Application Development**
- Write code once, run it anywhere (**Mobile, Web, Desktop, IoT, Blockchain**).
- Supports **game development (2D, 3D, VR/AR)** with optimized rendering.
- Native support for **web applications**, **server-side programming**, and **desktop software**.
- Full compatibility with **Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS**.

### **2. High Performance & Speed**
- **LLVM-based JIT/AOT compilation** ensures the fastest possible execution.
- **Direct memory access & inline assembly** allows hardware-level optimization.
- Optimized runtime with **parallel processing, vectorization, and GPU acceleration**.
- Real-time processing for **robotics, AI, and industrial IoT** applications.

### **3. Multi-Paradigm & AI Integration**
- Supports **functional, object-oriented, and procedural programming** styles.
- **AI-powered compiler optimization** for smart performance tuning.
- Intelligent **error detection and auto-debugging** powered by machine learning.
- **Neural network-assisted code generation and auto-completion**.

### **4. Quantum Computing & Blockchain Integration**
- **Quantum computing support** with advanced cryptographic algorithms.
- Fully integrated **blockchain features**:
  - **Sharding, Layer 2 scaling, zk-Rollups** for high-speed transactions.
  - **Hybrid PoS + DAG consensus model** for security and efficiency.
  - **Smart contracts powered by AI** for auto-verification and fraud detection.
- **Native cryptocurrency AlphaCoin (ALPHA)** for governance, gas fees, and staking.

### **5. Dynamic Yet Statically Optimized**
- **Interpreted & dynamically typed** (like Python) but **compiles down to ultra-fast machine code**.
- High-performance **standard library inspired by Flutter’s LibraryInit** for UI/UX development.
- **Low-level system control with high-level usability**, making it perfect for embedded systems.

### **6. Direct Hardware & IoT Support**
- **Inline assembly for hardware-level programming** (like C/Assembly).
- **Direct control of microcontrollers (Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP32, STM32, etc.)**.
- **Low-latency execution for real-time applications** such as robotics and automation.
- **Optimized support for industrial IoT, AI-powered sensors, and edge computing**.

## Installation
### **Prerequisites**
- **C++17 or later** (GCC/Clang/MSVC)
- **LLVM** (for IR generation and optimizations)
- **CMake** (for project building)
- **Python 3.x** (for optional scripting and automation features)

### **Installation Steps**
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/OmniCode/OmniCode.git
cd OmniCode

# Build the compiler
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)

# Run the OmniCode REPL
./omnicode_repl
```

## Example Program (Hello, World!)
```omn
func main() {
    print("Hello, World!");
}
```

### **More Examples**
#### **Fibonacci Sequence**
```omn
func fibonacci(n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    }
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
}

print(fibonacci(10));
```

#### **Interacting with Hardware (IoT Example)**
```omn
func blink_led() {
    pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
    while (true) {
        digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
        delay(1000);
        digitalWrite(13, LOW);
        delay(1000);
    }
}
```
