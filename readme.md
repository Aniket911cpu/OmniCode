**OmniCode: The Ultimate Universal Programming Language**

# **1. Introduction**
OmniCode is a groundbreaking programming language designed to merge the best features of existing languages while eliminating their limitations. It supports a hybrid execution model (JIT + AOT), offers high-level abstraction while allowing low-level hardware control, and is optimized for web development, mobile applications, game development, blockchain technology, quantum computing, and IoT applications.

This documentation provides an extensive overview of OmniCode’s syntax, features, implementation details, and real-world applications.
